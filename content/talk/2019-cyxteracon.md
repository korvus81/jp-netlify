  IT is expected to stand-up infrastructure to support new applications and scale capacity to meet growing demand - in minutes and hours, not days or weeks. Yet cloud isn’t always a fit for many workloads. Others can’t move to the cloud for reasons of security, control or cost.  Modern IT leaders must deliver the speed and agility the business demands with the control that comes with dedicated, cyber-resilient infrastructure. In this Fireside Chat, IT leader Jeff Poole shares his lessons learned defining and implementing the hybrid IT strategy for a leading smart home provider serving one million customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Topics will include how to choose the best fit platform – enterprise data center, colocation, or cloud - to support mission critical operations, DevOps and more.
