publication: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference, New York
abstract: Jeff Poole offers an overview of the reasons why you might design a system to run in multiple data centers. You get performance improvements: improving end-user latency and transfer speed as well as reducing lag in real-time media and command-and-control applications. More importantly, being geographically distributed can improve uptime and resilience to natural disasters or network issues that could plague a single data center.

Jeff Poole offers an overview of the reasons why you might design a system to run in multiple data centers. You get performance improvements: improving end-user latency and transfer speed as well as reducing lag in real-time media and command-and-control applications. More importantly, being geographically distributed can improve uptime and resilience to natural disasters or network issues that could plague a single data center.

Jeff then explores the concepts to consider when moving to a multi-data-center deployment:

Smart routing and/or service discovery, with different approaches relevant to different applications depending on their latency requirements and dependencies on data within the system
A data strategyâ€”deciding how painful it will be to write to data stores far away and determining if your application can tolerate stale data and how stale that data can be
An examination of fail-over scenarios in case of a full data center outage, ensuring that you can route traffic to better destinations, recover all your data, and have a way to take over for any database primaries that were in the failed datacenter
Tolerance for a reduction in capability, such as the ability to operate in a read-only state
Jeff concludes by walking you through some scenarios of different applications, explaining how trade-offs may be applied to those scenarios and discussing the different choices you might make between a real-time communications platform and a data-heavy web application, and how those choices might be moderated by different uptime requirements.
